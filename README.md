# Caraya Rivendellweb

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install caraya/rivendellweb/<formula>`

Or `brew tap caraya/rivendellweb` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).

## Important Note

This is not a public tap. I'm using it to learn about tap manangement and how to add formulas to the custom tap. If it helps you then great but I'm not going to be maintaining it or addressing issues or pull requests from contributors.
